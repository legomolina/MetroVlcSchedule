> Archived project. Since latests versions of Metro Valencia Website they introduced an _API_ and you can obtain most of the data this API provided, so just open the Network tab and see the request. Also, cards balance is now under user login so I can't obtain that data.

A public API for consulting MetroValencia schedule.
